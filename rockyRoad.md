# The Rocky Road
You choose the rocky road, guided by the sound of rushing water. The path is steep and treacherous, slick with mist and loose stones. As you descend, the air grows colder, and the roar of the river becomes louder. Finally, the mist parts, revealing a swift, clear river cutting through the ravine. On the other side, a moss-covered stone archway looms, inscribed with the same strange symbols from the forest.

At the riverâ€™s edge, a shimmering figure appears, its form shifting like water. It points to the river and whispers in your mind: "To cross, you must give. The river takes what it is owed."

You stand there, realizing the path forward demands a sacrifice. The water churns before you, waiting for your decision.
