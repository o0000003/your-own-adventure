# The Rocky Road
You choose the rocky road, guided by the smell of rushing water. The path is cute, slick with mist and kidney stones. As you descend, the air gets raunchier, and the roar of the river becomes louder. Finally, the mist parts, revealing a swift, clear river of fire cutting through the ravine. On the other side, a dirt covered stone archway looms, inscribed with the same strange symbols from the forest.

At the riverâ€™s edge, a shimmering figure appears, its form shifting like water. It points to the river and whispers in your mind: "To cross, you must give. The river takes what it is owed."

You sit there, realizing the path forward demands a sacrifice. The water churns before you, waiting for your decision.
