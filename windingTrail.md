# The Winding Trail

You choose the winding trail, drawn by the soft, golden light in the distance. As you walk, the trees begin to thin, and the air becomes warmer. The trail is lined with vibrant wildflowers, their petals glowing faintly as if infused with magic. The golden light grows brighter with each step, but an uneasy feeling settles in your chest.

Suddenly, you hear footsteps behind you. You glance back, but no one is there. The trail begins to wind more sharply, and just as you round a corner, you come face-to-face with an ancient stone statueâ€”a towering figure with hollow eyes and a stern expression. At its feet lies a small, wooden box, its lid slightly ajar.
