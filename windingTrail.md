# The Winding Trail

You choose the winding trail, drawn by the soft, golden light in the distance. As you walk, the trees begin to thin, and the air grows warmer. The path is adorned with vibrant wildflowers, their petals shimmering faintly as if touched by magic. The golden light intensifies with each step, but a sense of unease grows within you.

Suddenly, you hear rustling behind you. You glance back, but see no one. The path twists more sharply, and as you navigate a bend, you come face-to-face with an ancient stone statueâ€”a towering figure with hollow eyes and a grave expression. A small, wooden chest rests at its base, its lid slightly open.
