You decide to take the narrow path, but as you walk deeper into the forest, the whispers grow fainter until they vanish entirely. The dense canopy above closes in, blocking out what little light remains, and an eerie stillness falls over the forest. The energy in the ground dissipates, leaving the earth cold and unfeeling.

After what seems like hours of wandering, you reach a dead end. Before you, the path is blocked by a thick wall of ancient, twisted vines that no weapon could cut through. There are no altars, no treasures, and no way forward. The strange symbols you once saw on the trees are nowhere to be found, and the air no longer hums with magic. It's as if the forest itself has trapped you in a forgotten corner, a place where even the whispers have abandoned you.

You try to retrace your steps, but the path behind you has vanished, swallowed by the forest. Exhaustion sets in as the dark woods close in, and you realize this journey might end here, with no further choices, no revelations, and no escape.

The forest holds its secrets close, and you have reached its end.

The End.
