# The Narrow Path

You decide to take the narrow path, but as you walk deeper into the forest, the whispers become faint echoes, then fade into nothing. The canopy above thickens, until not a single sliver of light can break through. The silence is heavy, pressing against your skin like a suffocating shroud. The once lively energy of the forest drains away, leaving the ground beneath your feet cold and lifeless.

After what feels like an eternity of walking, you arrive at a dead end. A towering wall of ancient, gnarled vines blocks your path, each twisted knot resembling the faces of forgotten souls. No weapon could hope to slice through them. There are no altars, no treasures, not even the strange symbols that once adorned the trees. The air is still and empty, devoid of the magic that once hummed through the leaves. You are in a forgotten corner of the forest, a place that even the whispers refuse to acknowledge.

You turn back, but the path has vanished entirely, replaced by an impenetrable thicket of trees and undergrowth. Panic sets in as you realize you are truly lost. The forest, once so full of cryptic life, has become an indifferent prison. Your limbs grow heavy with exhaustion, your thoughts hazy, as if the forest itself is draining your will to continue.

You collapse to the ground, the cold earth cradling you like a final embrace. The forest holds its secrets, and you have become one of them.

The End.
