# Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!

You wake up in the middle of a dense, mysterious forest. The trees tower above you, their branches intertwining to form a canopy so thick, barely any sunlight gets through. The air is damp, and the sound of rustling leaves echoes around you. You have no memory of how you got here, but one thing is clearâ€”this is no ordinary forest. Strange symbols are carved into the bark of the trees, and the ground beneath you pulses with an odd, magical energy.

Ahead, you see three distinct paths:

1. A **narrow path** leading deeper into the dark forest, where faint whispers seem to call your name.
2. A **winding trail** towards a distant clearing, where a soft, golden light glows through the trees.
3. A **rocky road** that descends into a misty ravine, from which you can hear the sound of rushing water.

**What will you do?**
